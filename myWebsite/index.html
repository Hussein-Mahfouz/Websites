<p>A SPECTRE is haunting Europe--the spectre of Communism. All the Powers of old Europe have
entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot,
French Radicals and German police-spies.<p>

<p>Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as Communistic by its opponents
in power? Where the Opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of Communism, against
the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries? </p>
